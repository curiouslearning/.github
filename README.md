# Pull Requests
Review code changes prior to merging them into main branches. This also links up PR details to our JIRA task cards.

This gives us an opportunity to make sure we are meeting our standards:
- Meeting task acceptance criteria
- Optimal implementation
- Unit testing
- Avoiding potential performance impacts
- Clean up debugging/testing code


## Squashing commits
More often than not, we make commits containing work-in-progress (WIP), which makes more sense for authors but not much for paper trail and reviewers.
We also rely more on the PR for the details.
This keeps our commit log clean, consistent and easier to keep track of.

Tracking benefits
`git log --all --grep='Fix:'`
`git log --all --grep='FT-123â€™'`

## Format
Pull requests should contain enough details to help reviewers understand the nature of the change and help them perform reviews effectively. Keeping formats consistent would also lead to better collaboration across teams (if and when the need arises).

Following this format gives way for automation in terms of creating release notes, reports, etc.
The format would also immediately inform reviewers what the change is about and contains the reference to the jira task, reducing back and forth clarifications.

Types:
- Feat - used for new features
- Update - when introducing optimizations and/or enhancements
- Fix - for bug fixes
- Chore - non functional requirements like adding unit tests, refactoring, adding readme, etc.

Subject: `<type>: <short subject/description> (<jira-code>)`
